                    <p>
                        This project is about an interactive science museum called the CS Museum, short for "Community Science Museum" It's
                        core target audience is primary and middle school children (7-15) and families with young children.

                    <h3>Changes</h3>
                    <p>
                        For this project, I decided to completely rework it. Based on the feedback from the site before the rework, there
                        had been too much use of illustrations and images. Difficult colors and contrast ratios. So with this rework I
                        wanted to make it neat looking, easy to navigate, and have more manageable color schema. Gone are most of the
                        images, and all the illustrations. I wanted something on the front page to appeal to the target audience, so I put
                        up sections to Rob the robot, and the clubs to engage children. This project came with a copy, and I felt like in
                        order to get all the information neatly presented I needed at least 5 pages since there were a lot of information
                        included.

                            Decided to chang the logo, and make it more modern looking. Here I put a drop of water in front of the logo
                            name. My thoughts was a link to rain and Rainydays rough clothing for all weathers.
